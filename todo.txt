[x] Create a dialog form for the new todo button.
[x] Figure out how to associate todo form with project in focus. Add data-project attribute
    to todo-section.
[x]  Make createTodoCard take an object containing project name and todo so it can 
    work with pubsub.
[x] Add an edit button to the hiddenContent of each todo.
[x] Fix New Project button so it correctly makes the project key and id property identical
   and also allows user to change the name of the project.
[] Give edit button functionality. Probably need to add a 'complete' button to signal the
   end of changes.
[x] Allow edit button to be clicked without minimizing the card. Attach event listener to div.title,
    i.e. previous sibling. Edit toggleContentVisibility to target the expandable content via
    the sibling relationship.
[] Put dueDate inside of its own div or span to make it easier to target during editing.
