[x] Create a dialog form for the new todo button.
[x] Figure out how to associate todo form with project in focus. Add data-project attribute
    to todo-section.
[x]  Make createTodoCard take an object containing project name and todo so it can 
    work with pubsub.
[x] Add an edit button to the hiddenContent of each todo.
[x] Fix New Project button so it correctly makes the project key and id property identical
   and also allows user to change the name of the project.
[] Give edit button functionality. Probably need to add a 'complete' button to signal the
   end of changes.
[x] Allow edit button to be clicked without minimizing the card. Attach event listener to div.title,
    i.e. previous sibling. Edit toggleContentVisibility to target the expandable content via
    the sibling relationship.
[x] Put dueDate inside of its own div or span to make it easier to target during editing.
[x] Make default project use dataset property of id instead of name.
[x] When editing project name, make it so that cursor automatically appears at end of text.
   Might need to use text input fields for this instead of divs? Just remove the borders
   with css?
[x] Add a delete btn to each todo card.
[x] Modify form submission so the creation of the Todo object occurs in the todoProject
   module instead of the displayController.
[x] Make edit form close button work. Use closest method in event listener.
[x] Create pubsub to modify todo card after submitting edit and changing the todo on the
   projects object.
   Making a mistake: every time I edit a todo, I replace it with a todo with identical content but a different id.
[] Make checklist input a series of text fields, the number of which can be increased by clicking a button.
[x] Fix bug where submitting a todo edit will decrement the date by one day if the date isn't modified.
[] Use Object.assign to add methods back to objects retreived from local storage.
   (Currently my objects do not have methods.)
[] Add object methods to ToDo. Could probably be useful for when edits are made.
[x] Review:
   https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=js+date-fns+format+decrements+the+day+by+one
   Needed parseISO method. Edits don't decrement the time but the original timestamp appears
   to be decremented by one day...   
   Still an issue since created a new todo produces a date one day earlier than the selection.
   Still need to call Date method on original string?

   Had to use parseISO and put the dueDate of the default todo in the same format as the
   pre-filled values for the edit form.
[x] Make deleting todo card modify the project's todos in the localStorage.
[] Make the default project have focus() regardless of whether there are additional
   projects saved.
[] Fix bug where refreshing the page leads to todos from all projects being displayed.
   Once I click on a particular project, this is fixed, but only the default projects todos
   should display.
